# Rust library to interact with all the explorers

`scans-rs` is a Rust library designed to serve as a comprehensive tool for interacting with a wide range of blockchain explorers and coin information services. It provides developers with a unified API to query different block explorers across multiple blockchain networks, facilitating access to blockchain transaction details, wallet balances, smart contract interactions, and other blockchain-specific data. Additionally, `scans-rs` includes functionality for retrieving pricing and other relevant information about various cryptocurrencies from coin explorers. This library aims to simplify the process of integrating blockchain data and crypto asset information into Rust applications by abstracting away the differences between the various explorers and presenting a cohesive interface to the user. Whether you're developing cryptocurrency wallets, analytics tools, or any application that requires detailed blockchain data, `scans-rs` can help streamline your development process by offering a single point of access to a multitude of blockchain and cryptocurrency data sources.
